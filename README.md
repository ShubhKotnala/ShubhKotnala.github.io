# Personal Website
This repository contains the source for the website `shubhkotnala.giothub.io`
The purpose of this website is to create an online portfolio that contains details about me and my work both professional and personal

This repository should not be considered as a project in my Github Repository as this is just for the purpose of presenting a portfolio. 

### Tools and Technologies Used
The main website showcasing the portfolio is a fork of [vcard-personal-portfolio](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio), do have a look for more information. 

There are contents apart from the main website into this repository which can be discarded, as they have a limited, but required scope, that may or may not be directly linked to the website.
